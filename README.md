# eslint-config-fluct

## Basic Principles for Settings

- Ban a dengerous style.
- Sort a style to avoid errors and to increase productivity.
- We set rules as _error_ if we think such style causes mistake easily ABSOLUTELY.
  - In other words, we make them an error that dengerous, foot-gun, or explicit mistake.
- We set rules as _warn_,  if we think such style might be ugly
  but it's useful for debugging or you might write when trying an approach.
  - You can land a patch without fixing warning. But YOU should fix them.
- We set rules as _off_ if it is just a stylistic problem and there are no increasing any productivity.
